As part of Applied Data Science Program , completed 3 project 
a) Food Delivery Project illustrates the Statistics and Python skills for data analysis and visualization


b) Elective project based on Practical Data Science technqiues( decision trees )
Context :  ExtraaLearn is an initial-stage startup that offers programs on
cutting-edge technologies to students and professionals to help
them upskill/reskill. With a large number of leads being generated
on a regular basis, one of the issues faced by ExtraaLearn is to
identify which of the leads are more likely to convert so that they
can allocate the resources accordingly. You, as a data scientist at
ExtraaLearn, have been provided the leads data to:
Analyze and build an ML model to help identify which leads are
more likely to convert to paid customers.
Find the factors driving the lead conversion process.
Create a profile of the leads which are likely to convert.
skills applied: EDA(Univariate Analysis, Multi Variate Analysis),
              Visualization, Data Preprocessing(Log
              transformations, Outlier Treatment, Missing Value
              Treatment, Feature Engineering), Classification
              Models(Logistic Regression, Descision Trees,
              Random Forest), Model Performance evaluation and
              improvement (Cross Validation Techniques)
c) Capstone Project + PResentation :
   A bank's consumer credit department aims to simplify the decision-making process for home equity
lines of credit to be accepted. To do this, they will adopt the Equal Credit Opportunity Act's
guidelines to establish an empirically derived and statistically sound model for credit scoring. The
model will be based on the data obtained via the existing loan underwriting process from recent
applicants who have been given credit. The model will be built from predictive modeling techniques,
but the model created must be interpretable enough to provide a justification for any adverse
behavior (rejections).
Skills applied: Problem DEfinition, EDA(Univariate Analysis, Multi Variate Analysis),
              Visualization, Data Preprocessing(Log
              transformations, Outlier Treatment, Missing Value
              Treatment, Feature Engineering), Classification
              Models(Logistic Regression, Descision Trees,
              Random Forest), Model Performance evaluation and
              improvement (Cross Validation Techniques)
              Presentation with recommended model.
